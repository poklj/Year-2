Classes provided: 

Timer - simulated time source; the usage will been demonstrated in class

Rand - generates double numbers uniformly distributed over (0,1] 
       (drand() -  used by Delay()); 
       or [0,1] (drand0() - used by Shift() - not in the Airport assignment)

Delay - generates exponentially distributed random numbers (integers)
	Use it to generate delays (gaps between planes, or runway service time).


Queue - while you may use your own Queue, I encourage you to thoroughly review 
        the three versions provided here: 
	1. simple fixed-size, circular buffer-based Queue i
	   (Queue.h & Queue.cpp)
	2. circular buffer-based, dynamically allocated, Queue Template 
           (CBQueueT.h)
	3. circular linked list-based Queue Template
	   (CLLQueueT.h)

Stat  - well, these are some older pieces/experiments; some like them, some don't, 
Stats   them confusing, hard to use, or useless...  ;(
